<h1>🧾 About Me</h1>

<p>Hi! I'm Adegboyega - an aspiring web developer👨🏽‍💻,with a passion for creativity, storytelling, and design. I'm currently exploring the world of frontend development, learning how to bring ideas to life through clean and meaningful code. </p>

<p>Right now, I’m learning how to build clean, purposeful websites using HTML, and enjoying every bit of the process. Whether it’s crafting a simple birthday invite page 🎂 or curating a movie recommendation site 🎞️, I like finding new ways to blend storytelling with structure- and a touch of fun too. </p>

<p>Outside of the screen, I’m big on expression - whether through writing ✍🏽, performing 🎭, or just sharing life with others. I believe in doing things with heart, and I bring that same energy into every project I build ⚡⚡.</p>

<p>This space is where I document the journey - every click, every line of code, every lesson. You’re welcome to stick around😉.</p>
